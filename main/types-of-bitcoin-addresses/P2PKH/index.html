<h1>P2PKH (Pay to Public Key Hash) Bitcoin Addresses</h1>

<h2>What are P2PKH Addresses?</h2>
<p>P2PKH, which stands for "Pay to Public Key Hash," is one of the most standard and widely used types of Bitcoin addresses. These addresses start with the number "1" and are a fundamental part of the Bitcoin network.</p>

<h2>How P2PKH Works</h2>
<p>P2PKH addresses are created by taking a public key and performing cryptographic operations on it. The process involves:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Applying a SHA-256 hash to the public key.</li>
    <li>Running the result through a RIPEMD-160 hash.</li>
    <li>Adding network bytes.</li>
    <li>Generating a checksum.</li>
    <li>Encoding the result in Base58 to create the final address.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why P2PKH?</h2>
<p>P2PKH addresses are essential for ensuring that only the owner of the corresponding private key can spend the Bitcoins. They provide a layer of security and are fundamental to how Bitcoin transactions work.</p>

<h2>Generating a P2PKH Address in Go</h2>
<p>Here's an example of how you might generate a P2PKH address in Go:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "crypto/sha256"
    "golang.org/x/crypto/ripemd160"
    "encoding/hex"
)

func main() {
    // Replace this with your public key
    publicKey := "yourPublicKeyInHexFormat"

    // Step 1: SHA256 hashing of the public key
    shaHasher := sha256.New()
    shaHasher.Write([]byte(publicKey))
    shaHashed := shaHasher.Sum(nil)

    // Step 2: RIPEMD-160 hashing on the result of SHA-256
    ripemdHasher := ripemd160.New()
    ripemdHasher.Write(shaHashed)
    ripemdHashed := ripemdHasher.Sum(nil)

    // Further steps would involve adding network bytes, generating checksum, and Base58 encoding
    // These steps are omitted for brevity

    // Output the RIPEMD-160 hash as an example
    fmt.Println("RIPEMD-160 Hash: ", hex.EncodeToString(ripemdHashed))
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: This code provides a basic example and does not include all the steps necessary for creating a fully valid Bitcoin address, such as adding network bytes, generating a checksum, and Base58Check encoding.</p>

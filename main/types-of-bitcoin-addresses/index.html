<h1>Types of Bitcoin Addresses</h1>

<h2>1. P2PKH (Pay to Public Key Hash)</h2>
<p>Example: <b>1</b>A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa</p>
<p>This is the most standard and common type of address, starting with "1". It represents a hash of the user's public key. This was the first type of address used in Bitcoin.</p>

<h2>2. P2SH (Pay to Script Hash)</h2>
<p>Example: <b>3</b>J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLy</p>
<p>These addresses start with "3". They are used for transactions that require the execution of a specific script, such as multisig transactions.</p>

<h2>3. Bech32 (also known as "bc1 addresses")</h2>

<p>Example: <b>bc1</b>qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwf5mdq</p>

<p>This is a new format of addresses introduced with the SegWit (Segregated Witness) update. They start with "bc1" and feature lower transaction fees and improved resistance to input errors.</p>

<h2>4. P2WPKH (Pay to Witness Public Key Hash) and P2WSH (Pay to Witness Script Hash)</h2>
<p>Example: <b>bc1</b>qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwf5mdq</p>

<p>These are variants of Bech32 addresses, designed for optimizing transaction size and efficiency. P2WPKH is used for single-signature transactions, while P2WSH is for more complex script transactions.</p>

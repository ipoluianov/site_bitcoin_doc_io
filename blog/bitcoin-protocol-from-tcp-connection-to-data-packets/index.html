<h1>Bitcoin Protocol: From TCP Connection to Data Packets</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>TCP Connection</h2>
            <p>
                Bitcoin utilizes the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to facilitate data exchange between nodes. Nodes in the Bitcoin network typically listen for incoming connections on port 8333. During the initiation of a connection, nodes exchange messages to verify compatibility and synchronize.

            <h2>Message Format</h2>
            <p>
                Messages within the Bitcoin network follow a specific format, comprising a header and a message body. The header contains essential information for message identification and validation, including its length and checksum. The message body carries the actual information being transmitted.
            </p>

            <h2>Types of Messages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>version</strong>: A message for establishing a connection between nodes, containing the node's protocol version information.</li>
                <li><strong>verack</strong>: A response to the version message, confirming the establishment of a connection.</li>
                <li><strong>ping</strong> and <strong>pong</strong>: Keep-alive messages to maintain and check the connection's integrity.</li>
                <li><strong>addr</strong>: Communicates the IP addresses of other nodes.</li>
                <li><strong>inv</strong>: Informs other nodes about new transactions or blocks.</li>
                <li><strong>getdata</strong>: A request for specific transactions or blocks.</li>
                <li><strong>block</strong>: Contains complete block data.</li>
                <li><strong>tx</strong>: Contains transaction data.</li>
                <li><strong>getblocks</strong> and <strong>getheaders</strong>: Requests for block information.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Data Exchange and Verification</h2>
            <p>
                After establishing a connection, nodes exchange information about available blocks and transactions. Upon receiving a new transaction or block, a node verifies them to ensure their validity and compliance with Bitcoin network rules.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Blockchain Synchronization</h2>
            <p>
                New nodes connecting to the network must synchronize the existing blockchain. This is achieved by requesting and sequentially downloading blocks from other network nodes.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Relaying Transactions and Blocks</h2>
            <p>
                Once a transaction or block is verified, it is relayed to other nodes in the network, ensuring its dissemination throughout the network.
            </p>

        <h1>Detailed Overview of the 'version' Message in the Bitcoin Protocol</h1>
        <p>
            The 'version' message plays a crucial role in the Bitcoin network, facilitating the establishment of a connection between nodes. It is one of the first messages sent after a new connection is established and is critical in ensuring that the connecting nodes are compatible.
        </p>
        <section>
            <h2>Structure of the 'version' Message</h2>
            <p>
                The 'version' message is composed of several fields, each serving a specific purpose in the connection process. The following are the key components of the 'version' message:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>version</strong>: An integer indicating the protocol version being used by the sending node.</li>
                <li><strong>services</strong>: A bitfield that describes the services supported by the node.</li>
                <li><strong>timestamp</strong>: The current time, represented as a Unix epoch timestamp.</li>
                <li><strong>addr_recv</strong>: The network address of the receiving node.</li>
                <li><strong>addr_from</strong>: The network address of the sending node.</li>
                <li><strong>nonce</strong>: A random number used to detect connections to self.</li>
                <li><strong>user_agent</strong>: A string that identifies the client software being used by the sending node.</li>
                <li><strong>start_height</strong>: The number of the last block received by the sending node.</li>
                <li><strong>relay</strong>: A boolean value indicating whether the node wants to receive relayed transactions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Purpose of Each Field</h2>
            <p>
                Each field in the 'version' message serves a specific purpose in the node communication process:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>version</strong>: Helps in determining whether the nodes are capable of understanding each other's messages.</li>
                <li><strong>services</strong>: Indicates specific functionalities like whether the node can serve full block data or only headers.</li>
                <li><strong>timestamp</strong>: Facilitates time synchronization between nodes.</li>
                <li><strong>addr_recv</strong> and <strong>addr_from</strong>: Used to share network addresses, assisting in network topology mapping.</li>
                <li><strong>nonce</strong>: Prevents a node from accidentally connecting to itself.</li>
                <li><strong>user_agent</strong>: Provides information about the node's software for network analytics and compatibility purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>start_height</strong>: Gives information about the height of the sender's blockchain, useful in synchronization processes.</li>
                <li><strong>relay</strong>: Nodes can signal whether they wish to receive broadcast transactions or not.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Importance in the Network</h2>
            <p>
                The exchange of 'version' messages is a fundamental step in establishing a functional connection between Bitcoin nodes. It ensures that only compatible nodes communicate, thereby maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the network.
